# Object-Detection
Object detection neural networks codes, includes Faster-RCNN, Centernet, YOLO V4 (Tensorflow 2.0 Version)

The three object detection neural networks can be used into the automatic driving area. it can help cars to identify cars, people, plants, traffic lights and other objects

In the comparison of the same task by using above three networks, it can be known that Yolo V4 has the best overall performance

The identification example is shown in the img folder in every project
